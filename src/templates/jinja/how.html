  <p class="lead">Friday Film Club is an invite only, very simple yet competitive distraction designed for you to pitch your wits against other lovers of film. There is nothing to win... apart from pride, respect and kudos. And who needs gimmicky prizes when there’s an opportunity to rub those three qualities in the faces of your closest friends?!</p>
  <h4>Here’s how it works:</h4>
  <p>Each Friday at 12 noon you will be sent an email and the clock will start ticking.</p>
  <p>Just as there are leagues under the sea, the counter is set to <b>20,000</b> and will drop down by 1 every single second from the email being sent. Click on the link within the email to start your play.</p>
  <p>You’ll be presented with a screenshot of a film and the quicker you guess correctly, the more points you’ll secure - the points correspond exactly to the timer. If the timer stops on 12472 then this is what your score will be for that week.</p>
  <p>Now, the number geeks &amp; mathematicians amongst you will realise that this means you’ll have just under 6 hours to successfully play the game or you’ll be receiving nil point, zero, zilch, nada, nothing-at-all regardless of whether you can answer the question or not. </p>
  <blockquote class="text-muted">
    <p>“Oh but there was an office meeting called and we couldn't log on!”</p>
    <p>“I went into labour; I had to prioritise”</p>
    <p>“Email? I don’t remember receiving an email” </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>All, I am sure, very appropriate excuses, but none will change the fact that you either play the game in time the following week or you’ll be scoring a negative double whammy! </p>
  <blockquote class="text-muted">
    <p>“Seems a bit tough, what if I don’t quite recognise the screenshot first time round?” </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t recognise the screenshot you have 3 clues available to you. But use a clue or submit an incorrect answer and you’ll instantly drop <b>2,000</b> points. </p>
  <blockquote class="text-muted">
    <p>“What if the timer only says 1000 points remaining and I need to ask for a clue??</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If that’s the case, my film loving friend, then I’ll allow you to finish on zero points if you finally answer correctly. Yes it’s only zero, but it's better than a minus figure. You'll just have to work harder the following week to make those points up! </p>
  <p>Easy, right? Well some weeks it will be and you’ll be top of the leader board. Other weeks it won’t be and you’ll be down with the... err... morlocks? </p>
  <p>Either way, one thing is for sure: everyone else playing wants to secure more points than you. Especially your friends. </p>
  <p>And as a fully registered member you’ll receive 20 invites to send out to future rivals to help prove that you’re the EXACT person they should to turn to when it comes to recognising the Goon Docks or the back of Anthony Hopkins’ head!  </p>
  <p>As Kevin Bacon once said: <i>“These are the fact of the case, and they are undisputed”</i> so that's it, folks. </p>
  <p>Oh and one final thing. Every twelve weeks the current Friday Film Club season ends and another begins. So, if you’re having a tough run of luck or joined the Club late in the day, fear not, you can start afresh after week 12 and use the remainder of the season you are currently in to hone your answering skills. </p>
  <p>Good luck, everyone. And may the best Club member win... my respect! </p>
